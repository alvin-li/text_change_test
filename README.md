Nowadays, customers are being greatly influenced by what others have done. Buyers tend to buy products that have already been purchased by the others.

That’s the reason why the “Also bought” app becomes one of the necessary tools for every Shopify store. By giving smart recommended products as well as frequently bought products list, the shop revenues will be amazingly increased.

This app has the super user-friendly interface as well as simplest configuration steps. No developer skills required.
Additionally, it is also compatible with all Shopify themes.

# How does recommended products work?

At first, the system takes out the list of products based on the relevant conditions which have been defined by the website administrator inside the related products app.
Shoppers can see the recommended products list in three different positions:

* In the product detail page, between the “Add to cart” button and product information: Buyers can add all products to cart with just one click.
* In the product detail page, above the footer (in carousel style)
* In cart page

# Related products by Relevant conditions

The related products app selects the most relevant product recommendations based on the condition list such as:

* Manual: Set recommended items for each product manually.
* Bought together: Automatically analyze the store’s order information to give out the frequently also bought products list.
* Same collection - Show related products in the same collection
* Same product type - Show related products in the same product type
* Same product tags - Show related products in the same product tag
* And much more!

Admin can set the priority order of those conditions for related products

# Frequently Bought Together just like Amazon.
The app automatically analyze the store’s order information to give out the frequently bought together products list.
