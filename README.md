# Real-time data transfer
Data is sent from your shop to e-conomic in real-time, that means you can keep track of your revenue throughout the day when orders appear in e-conomic shortly after they have been made in your shop.

The IEX dashboard allows you to easily control and configure the app. Here you can decide when orders are transferred to e-conomic according to financial state and follow statistics and logs.
With the app it is possible to set up storage synchronization so your inventory in e-conomic is automatically sent to your Shopify shop.
