# How does recommended products work?

At first, the system takes out the list of products based on the relevant conditions which have been defined by the website administrator inside the related products app.
Buyers can see the recommended products list in three different positions:

* In the product detail page, between the “Add to cart” button and product information: Buyers can add all products to cart with just one click.
* In the product detail page, above the footer (in carousel style)
* In cart page
