# AMP - Accelerated Mobile Pages

## Officially recommended by Google, AMP by Shop Sheriff allows you to create Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) which receive the coveted lightning bolt beside their mobile search result, meaning better organic SEO, nearly instant page-loads, and more revenue for your business.
