# Wholesale Pricing Discount (WPD)

Now you can offer wholesale prices for specific customers on your shopify store! Just select the customer or customer group, a specific discount type, and what product's you'd like to offer them for. You can choose collections, individual products, or the entire store. Have a lot of different customers and stockists? We also allow you to create minimum quantities or dollars spent for the order too. Specific wholesale shipping rates can be applied as well!

We integrate with Wholesale Order Form & ReOrder and Wholesale Lock Manager.

# Set discounts based on percentage and specific prices
No limit on the number of discounts you’d like to set. You can set by percentage off (ie 50% off), or by specific price (ie $19.99 for wholesale). Set specific prices with a price list.

# Set discounts for specific products, collections, or the entire store
Complete flexibility in setting discounts. Set discounts by product, collection or your site.

# Import/Export Prices
Have a lot of products and SKUs? Fill the prices out in excel and import them back into our system.

# Set volume and tiered discounts
Want to give discounts to customers that buy more? Our volume discount lets you reduce prices as the customer buys more. For example, if you buy 10 T-shirts, they are $9.99. If you buy 20 T-shirts, they are $7.99.

# Set minimum quantity or dollar requirements to receive discounts
Ensure customers buy enough products or total value ($$) before receiving the discount to check out with.

# Set advanced wholesale shipping rates
Reduce or increase shipping rates by amount a customer purchases.
