With this app you can easily create OLX ads for your products and manage them with bulk actions to activate, deactivate or delete the ads.

You can create one ad for each product or product variant, if your products have multiple variants.

The app works with OLX Romania, OLX Portugal and OLX Poland. For activating it on other OLX countries, please get in touch with us.

# Create or Edit the ad for one product or variant
In this case you have full control over the ad details, you can change price, title, description or the other attributes which depend on the selected category of the ad.
You can select up to eight images for the ad, from the product's images.

# Create ads for multiple products in one category
You can select multiple products and create ads for all of them, in one action, in the same OLX category.
When this option is used, the ads are created using the following rules:

* An ad will be created for each product variant, if it doesn't have one created, yet.
* All ads will use product's title and description shortened if necessary, to fit ad's limits.
* First 8 product images will be used.
* Attribute values will be replaced by defaults if defaults are defined for the selected category.

# Default attributes for speed and consistency.
Default attributes can be used in two ways:

* To preselect attribute values when you create a new ad for a product - after you select the ad category and the attributes for that category are displayed
* To set the value of an attribute when you create ads in bulk, for more products at the same time
Using this feature will save you time and ensure you have a consistent mapping between the OLX category attributes and your product variant options.
